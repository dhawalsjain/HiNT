# HiNT
### Hi-C for copy Number variations and Translocations detection

## Summary
HiNT is a computational approach, which can be applied to detect CNVs and inter-chromosomal translocations with breakpoints at single base pair resolution, within Hi-C data. HiNT has two main stages, stage1 does Hi-C data preprocessing, create Hi-C contact matrix, and stage2 detects CNVs or translocations or both in parallel.
